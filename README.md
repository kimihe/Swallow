# Project Guide
> All the practice of Swallow is for project Griffin.

* This project is a light-weight prototype of **Swallow**. 
* Design details and principles of **Swallow** can be found at **"[Swallow: Joint Online Scheduling and Coflow Compression in Datacenter Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8425204)", in *Proc. IPDPS*, Vancouver, May. 2018**.   
* You can also found our implementation in Spark-2.2.0 at: [Modified-Spark](https://github.com/kimihe/SparkInternals/tree/master/Source%20Codes%20Development/For_Source_Codes_Modifying_spark-2.2.0-debug). As the full source code project is large, we just put modified codes, mainly in module of `spark-core` and `network-common`.  
* In root directory `Swallow-master`, four subprojects are contained: **swallow**, **swallow-sim**, **swallow-benchmark** and **swallow-trace**.  

### swallow
Efficient flow scheduling system in data-intensive clusters, based on [Akka](http://akka.io/).  
**Development Language:** `Scala`.  
**Full Project:** [swallow](https://github.com/kimihe/Swallow/tree/master/swallow).

### swallow-sim
Trace-driven simulator for flow scheduling used in swallow.  
**Development Language:** `Scala`.  
**Full project:** [swallow-sim](https://github.com/kimihe/Swallow/tree/master/swallow-sim).

### swallow-benchmark
Modified [Hibench](https://github.com/intel-hadoop/HiBench) for swallow evaluation. It is also suitable for evaluating other big data frameworks (e.g., [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) and [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/)).  
**Full project:** [swallow-benchmark](https://github.com/kimihe/Swallow/tree/master/swallow-benchmark).

### swallow-trace
Synthesized data from real-world traces of data-intensive clusters.  
**Full project:**: [swallow-trace](https://github.com/kimihe/Swallow/tree/master/swallow-trace).

# Prerequisites
* JDK 8.
* sbt 0.13.13 or higher ([download here](http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html)).

# How to Download
1. Download from [https://github.com/kimihe/Swallow](https://github.com/kimihe/Swallow) or use `git clone git@github.com:kimihe/Swallow.git`.

2. Extract the zip file to a convenient location:

* On **Linux** and **OSX** systems, open a terminal and use the command unzip `Swallow-master.zip`. 
* On **Windows**, use a tool such as File Explorer to extract the project.

# How to Complile and Run
**Take `Swallow-master/swallow` as an example:**

* In a console, change directories to the top level of the unzipped project. For example, if you used the default project name, `Swallow-master`, and extracted the project to your root directory, from the root directory, enter: `cd Swallow-master/swallow`.

* In the above directory, enter `sbt compile` to compile the source codes and enter `sbt run` to execute the program. sbt will download project dependencies, build the project and compile the archived package. Output looks like this: 

```
Multiple main classes detected, select one to run:

 [1] examples.ExampleClusterApp
 [2] examples.ExampleMaster
 [3] examples.ExampleReceiver
 [4] examples.ExampleSender
 [5] examples.KMActorAggregation
 [6] examples.KMClusterApp
 [7] examples.KMLocalActor
 [8] examples.KMMasterActor
 [9] examples.KMRemoteActor

Enter number: 
```
* For example: enter `1` and select to run `[1] examples.ExampleClusterApp `. Then, you can start three new terminals to run `[2] examples.ExampleMaster`, `[4] examples.ExampleSender` and `[3] examples.ExampleReceiver`. 

* These four processes simulate a simplest distributed scheduling system. In this example, all of them are run on the same machine, you can modify the `application.conf` in directory `resources` to respectively configure their IP address and communication port. **Swallow can be deployed on different machines and run as a real distributed scheduling system.**

# Collaboration with Intellij IDEA
You can also organize this project with **Intellij IDEA**, just open from the root directory `Swallow-master/swallow`.
